## React Redux Toolkit Counter App

This project is a simple number increment and decrement application developed using React and Redux Toolkit. The application allows users to increase or decrease the number value through buttons located on different pages. Additionally, this value is stored in local storage, so it persists even if the page is refreshed.

## Features

• Increment and decrement buttons: Buttons within the application enable users to modify the number value.

• State management with Redux Toolkit: Application state is centrally managed using Redux Toolkit.

• Local Storage integration: The number value is stored in local storage, ensuring persistence even when the page is refreshed.
